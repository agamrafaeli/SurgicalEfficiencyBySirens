# Surgical Efficiency by Sirens

This repository analyzes how acute stress from air-raid sirens affects surgical complication rates in Israeli hospitals. It provides a reproducible pipeline for data validation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling and reporting. The code tracks complication outcomes individually (intraoperative and short-term by default; long-term when available) â€” no single composite outcome.

## Quick start

```bash
make install
make test
stress-surgery --help
```

See `READMES/` for component specific documentation.
