# Methodology

Primary estimand: causal effect of acute siren exposure during or immediately before surgery on probability of composite surgical success.

We treat siren occurrence as a natural experiment and adjust for case mix using covariates such as urgency, wound class, ASA class, time of day, and staffing metrics. Models include logistic regression, generalized estimating equations, difference-in-differences, Cox proportional hazards, and propensity weighting.

Limitations include measurement error in event timings, potential residual confounding, and changes in case scheduling during conflicts. All outputs use de-identified hashes only.
